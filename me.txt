Dev Environment Overview
    Must Have Java Development Kit (JDK)
        We must Have the Java Development Kit (JDK) Installed
        Spring 5 requires Java 8 or higher
    Software
        Java Application Server For Spring MVC web development. We use Tomcat server
        Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Use eclipse

Installing Tomcat on MS Windows
    Tomcat Version:
        New version of Tomcat 10 was released to support Jakarta EE 9(around February, 2021)
        In this release they renamed the packages, javax.* to jakarta.*
        This is a breaking change for java EE apps
        Spring 5 currently does not support the new package renaming Jakarta EE9. As a result, Spring 5 does not currently
            work on Tomcat 10
        We will use Tomcat 9 for our Spring 5 apps
