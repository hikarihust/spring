        Java Application Server For Spring MVC web development. We use Tomcat server
        Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Use eclipse

Installing Tomcat on MS Windows
    Tomcat Version:
        New version of Tomcat 10 was released to support Jakarta EE 9(around February, 2021)
        In this release they renamed the packages, javax.* to jakarta.*
        This is a breaking change for java EE apps
        Spring 5 currently does not support the new package renaming Jakarta EE9. As a result, Spring 5 does not currently
            work on Tomcat 10
        We will use Tomcat 9 for our Spring 5 apps
    https://tomcat.apache.org/ -> https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi

Connecting Eclipse to Tomcat
    Benefits:
        Start Tomcat from Eclipse
        Easily deploy Application directly to Tomcat
    Workspace
        C:\Users\vudinhquang\eclipse-workspace
    Open Eclipse and at the bottom section there is a tab called servers and click on it. We do not have any servers
        associated with our Eclipse Environment at the time. So we need to do is click on link and add new server that poits 
        to our Tomcat that we installed
    Apache 
        open folder and scroll to select Tomcat 9
        Tomcat installation directly: Tell Eclipse where Tomcat is installed
            C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9.0
